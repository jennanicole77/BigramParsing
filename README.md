# BigramParsing

Create an application that can take as input any text (either a file or as a string) and output a histogram of the
bigrams in the text.

A bigram is any two adjacent words in the text. A histogram is a kind of graphical representation of numerical
data.

**Example**

Given the text: “The quick brown fox and the quick blue hare.”

The bigrams and their counts would be
* "the quick":2
* “quick brown”: 1
* “brown fox”: 1
* “fox and”: 1
* “and the”: 1
* “quick blue”: 1
* “blue hare”: 1
